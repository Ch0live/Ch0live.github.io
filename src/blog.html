      Ideally I'd like to add a Markdown interpreter like Jekyll to this part of my personal site,
      where I can simply dump .md files and have fully formatted posts.
      However, I also want to build this system from the ground up to understand exactly how it works,
      taking shortcuts with a pre-built GitHub pages site is too easy and I'll lose learning and customization
      opportunity.

      For now this space will remain rather blank as I work on this site.
      I hope to add more content here in the future.
