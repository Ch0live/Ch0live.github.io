        Yosemite

        Hello again readers! You join me in the beautiful state of California!
        After declaring we had no fruit or vegetables to the lone border force worker we entered the state, 
        noticing how fast the scenery of Nevada's deserts made way for California's Mojave vegetation.
        Driving from Las Vegas to Yosemite takes you past Mono Lake, a stunning viewpoint as you enter the state. 
        Today visibility was clear treating us to the view of the Sierra Nevada Mountains behind the lake.

        Following highway 120 the scenery only improved; 
        entering the mountains elevated our view of the area and in the evening light looked serene. 
        We pulled over to take in the view shown below.

        Quirky but convenient is how I'd review the hostel we stayed at. 
        This was the office entrance, with the bunks in the building further down the road. 
        Decking out back meant we could eat our dinner in the sunshine every evening. 
        Although the rooms were cramped and a bit expensive we couldn't complain; it's the cheapest accommodation within 15 minutes of a National Park entrance. 
        Plus I liked how colourful all the buildings were.

        Nevada Falls
    </h2>
    <p>
        Research suggested that this would be the best hike for us.
        As one of the most popular day hikes, the parking at the base in the morning can fill up fast. 
        After being fortunate in finding a space we started the climb.

        The walk follows the Merced River past both Vernal Falls and Nevada falls.

        Sadly the mist trail was closed due to damages to the path.
