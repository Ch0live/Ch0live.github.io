    <h1>
        Chicago, the home of the skyscraper
    </h1>

    <p>
        Hello again. In this post we are talking about the week I spent in Chicago. 
        Called the windy city (both for geographic and political reasons), Chicago is a big one being the largest city in the midwest. 
        Although a bit like London the majority of the population live a long way from the center where the actual boundaries of the city of Chicago lie. 
        Flying in you can see the massive metropolitan area this town covers in the state of Illinois. 
        Here's a photo of the city on the flight in; the skyscraper filled center is just a small percentage of this urban sprawl.

        I landed, checked into my hostel and then had just enough time to get some dinner. 
        I've barely eaten yet this day and as it's so famous I just couldn't say no to a Chicago deep dish pizza, distinct from having the tomato sauce atop the cheese. 
        The one below cost me $20 and after only being able to finish 2/3rds of it when sat at this bar it fed me for 2 days. 
        If you like loads of cheese <i>inside</i> your pizza, trust me, you'll love one of these.

        Day one is always spent just exploring the very city center which in Chicago basically means going to Millennium Park. 
        Here is my personal shot of arguably the most photographed thing in this town, the Bean. 
        I'd bet there's a photo taken of it every second during the day, the place was swarmed. 
        However as much as I joke on the number of photos there are of this thing it is very cool to look at.

        Especially from the inside! 
        I had only seen what it looks like from outside before visiting, but in the middle of it is definitely the most interesting view. 
        It's distorted mirror surface produces some wacky reflections. 
        The very center is like a shrunken down straight reflection of everyone underneath.
        The rest of it I can't quite rap my head around.

        I went around a few other parts of the park but most of it was actually closed off for the big event in town this weekend. 
        Nascar were running a street race and by pure luck I was in town on race day. 
        They had fenced off a bunch of streets in this central part of the city with tyres and concrete blocks. 
        This was the north entrance which I can confirm was the only one with a car on top of it. 
        Inside was a bunch of stalls and venders selling stuff as well as a load of businesses doing interactive things. 
        I had a go at the US Marine Core pull up bar challenge but fell 2 pull ups short of winning a water bottle. 
        Like a 10 year old they cheered me up with a free sticker, which worked.
