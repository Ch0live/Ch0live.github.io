        Kicking this all off
    </h1>

    <p>
        Hello! With only a little over a month until I go traveling I wanted to get ahead and create this space within
        my blog site for exclusively travel related posts. If all goes to plan (I'm not too tired, everything gets
        stolen, etc.) I hope to post about what I'm up to while away.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will be visiting the USA, Japan, Australia and New Zealand while I'm away.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will be spending more time in the US than the rest of my planned stops before returning home. It's been a key
        bucket list item for me to travel the USA in a vehicle of some kind. I've often written it down as "Drive the
        states" or "Travel the USA in a Ford F150", but ultimately I'd just like to experience America with the freedom
        to roam the places I wish to visit. There's so much to see, both natural and man-made, between the east and west
        coast of this monumentally large and influential county. So much that allocating a large amount of time with a
        personal car is really to only way to see it all. The number plates will also look great on the wall of whatever
        future garage I am able to call home later in life. They say in Europe, 1000 years isn't that long. In the US,
        1000 miles isn't that far. I'm keen to find out exactly how far that really feels.
    </p>
    <p>
        For less time, I will also be visiting other far off places that really can only be enjoyed by going for at
        least more than a 2 week summer holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm also curious to see the culture difference in Japan, a similarly developed country to the UK but with a
        completely different kind of rich history. The architecture, food and general Japanese culture are something I
        want to see before I die. It's going on the "countries to visit" list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Australia is just so far from the UK it has to be a stop on this globetrotting trip. Another naturally beautiful
        country as well as conveniently English speaking. Exactly which cities I'll explore and trails I'll walk are yet
        to be decided. But I'm exited to plan that part as I go.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Zealand is the final key place I'm keen to go. With family on the southern island I'm greatly looking
        forward to reconnecting with and, again, beautiful "tramping" trails to walk, it's another must-do while I'm
        away. As a fan of all things Tolkien, be sure I'll be visiting Hobbiton.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's all for now. With Visas and flights almost sorted it's all the little things to get ready. I'm hoping to
        pick up my perfect pair of walking shoes for the trip tomorrow, but as this is my 5th trip to the shops for them
        I may again get cold feet.

    <p>
        Thanks mum for the chest bag to hold my valuables in, I think it looks quite fashionable still. Plus I don't
        want my Lidl bum bag in all my photos, I know that wont be as funny to wear as it is now when I'm older.
