### Landing, Hiking, Service

Hello again. I wanted to share this photo of Nova Scotia (I believe) from above. The aircraft we flew in on was changed last minute and I was changed from a middle seat (B E) to a window seat (A/F). A big success which enabled me to get this shot on the flight in.

And I've landed! I'm writing this update retrospectively from a few days onwards, but in hindsight going through border control and getting picked up went very smoothly. Unlike JFK airport which is almost a small city by itself, Steward International is very small. Like 1 plane arriving every few hours small. I looked out the window and saw private propeller planes on the side of the runway while we taxied to one of the only disembarking spots. Border control, probably as a result of the lack of people going through it, was also very fast.

"Reason for your visit"
"I'm travelling for the summer across the USA"
"When do you plan to leave?"
"89 days from now in September"
"Ah, ok, you sure you're leaving before your visa expires?"
"Well I have a few flights in between but yes my flight leaves before then"
"ok, have a safe trip"

I was in the USA. Well almost. I still had to walk through the brilliantly uninspiring "Welcome to the United States" entrance. If it wasn't for the wording above the door I would have guessed it to be the fire escape.

My auntie, uncle and cousin were kind enough to collect me from the airport. On the way home I enjoyed my first US meal since I was 10 at Cracker Barrel. Andy recommended I try this chocolate and nut snack, which was very tasty. Almost like a circular snickers with marshmallow added.

The next day we went to church. It was a lovely enjoyable service consisting of singing with a full 4 piece band and production set up, a talk through satellite connection to the main church of the area and a few short readings from the bible. A new youth engagement lead was initiated. During one of the breaks a few people came over to us and welcomed me into their church. They all made me feel very welcome and I was grateful when wished a pleasant and safe journey across their country.

That afternoon we all had turkey, stuffing and green beans. One of many delicious dinners Karin has served me. In that afternoon we went hiking at Steep Rock Preserve.

On the walk we passed a cutting in the land with 2 power lines. Andy pointed out the old and new designs and explained the differences. It was clear which one was older and potentially more dangerous by the noise - the red frame lines hummed ferociously to an extent I have never heard before. I couldn't shake the idea I might conduct a deadly bolt of lightning from them by just walking underneath. We fortunately quickly moved on.

The rest of the walk was underneath the forested canopy. Paths cut through the growth and considering how close we were to home I was surprised to only see 1 other group walking here on a Sunday. A very pretty area to unwind after my previous day of traveling.

Stay tuned for more updates from my first full week in Connecticut.
