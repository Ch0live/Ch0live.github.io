        Seaside Hakodate
    </h1>
    <p>
        We have arrived by train to Hakodate, a seaside city on the southern tip of Hokkaido. 
        I mostly decided to come here as I wanted to travel to Honshu by ferry and this is where the terminal across the Tsugaru Strait is. 
        However Hakodate surprised me with lots to do and see.

        I walked all the way to the ticket barrier before I realised I left my ticket on the train. 
        Fortunately the staff member that I first approach picked it up and after some very broken Japanese from yours truly returned it to me. 
        Heading into town I passed the Kanemori Red Brick Warehouse, a mall full of souvenirs, food and a small post office booth. 
        It is on the right hand side in the photo below.

        I only spent one full day in Hakodate, packing it full of as much sightseeing as I possibly could. 
        First things first I need some good breakfast and in a town with good seafood I went straight to the Hakodate Morning Market. 
        I ordered crab legs in miso soup and tempura rice, only costing 800 yen or so. 
        It tasted very good, although I did struggle to eat the crab legs, unsure if I should bite into it like a chicken drumstick or scoop the insides out like a lobster. 
    </p>

        At the end of my meal a smiling lady started talking to me in Japanese. 
        After a lot of struggling back and forth to communicate I eventually get a translator out and ask her to speak into it. 
        The translated response came back as "you are very good using chopsticks". 
        It was a heartwarming moment with lots of thank yous from myself. 
        I explained a bit about where I am from and how long I am in Japan before recycling by breakfast bowls and heading out. 
        What a nice lady. 
    </p>

        A 45 minute walk is the actual time from the base of this walk to here, Hakodate mountain. 
        It's surprisingly short and made me glad I saved the yen on the cable car. 
        Same scenic view, but for free! 
    </p>

        I was very thirsty at this point and didn't realise the little inside space by the observation deck didn't open until 10AM. 
        While waiting and rationing the last of my water I saw and took a photo of this plaque. 
        It talks about the first people from Japan visiting the site of Hakodate in Hokkaido. 
        The bottom left I'm fairly confident says April 1957, and the bottom right is definitely Hakodate. 
    </p>

        I took a different walk down and went straight through the back of a Buddhist temple named Shomyo-ji (称名寺) (I think, reading the names is difficult, even with Google to help). 
    </p>

    <p>
        Walking back towards town I also visited the Old Public Ward of Hakodate. 
        It is a western designed house built in 1910 with a large publicly used meeting hall. 
        It was restored a few years ago to it's original yellow and blue colours and was only 150 yen to look around. 
        A bit like in the UK they had an optional extra to wear traditional almost Victorian looking (I don't know which era of style it was) clothes as you walked around. 
        When I got up to explore Hakodate I definitely didn't expect to see a bunch of Japanese women wearing traditional western clothes in a English looking manor house.

        Japan is known for having very individually unique and highly detailed manhole covers. 
        Where other countries just put the town name, Japanese towns put detailed illustrations of the more iconic things about the area. 
        If I think it's interesting I might put together a post just about the different covers I saw (again, I said <i>if</i> it is interesting). 
        For now enjoy this even more unique cover that was actually painted as well, depicting the Orthodox church by Hakodate Mountain.

        Now as you're reading a Ch0live post about somewhere, it wouldn't be complete without a photo of the trams. 
        Hakodate's are a complete mixture of old and new. 
        One I saw in the morning had a very modern and sleek design, again powered above using a pantograph and are 2 carriages long with a bendy connector. 
        The one I rode after lunch was much older, narrower and just a single carriage. 
        It seems instead of replacing the older routes the council here have just built new ones. 
        But if it means more reliable tram connections I'm all for it.

        One short tram ride later and we're at Goryōkaku, which apparently literally means 'five-point-star', built at the very end of the Edo period (1860s). 
        This makes sense as that's exactly how it was designed, with a star fort embankment and moat. 
        It's really quite eye-catching on the city map. 
    </p>

        This is the Former Magistrate Office built in the center of the fort grounds. 
        To make clear how big the full facility would have been markings have been left on the ground as to where the original building extended to. 
        Only around 1/3rd of this structure is still preserved and explorable.

        Here's a photo of the Red Brick Warehouse and harbour at dusk. 
        The moss on the front left warehouse looks great illuminated in the dark.

        That evening I went to Lucky Pierrot Hamburger. 
        After posting the set meal I ordered on Instagram I did have a friend message me asking why I was eating burgers while in Japan. 
        This chain is exclusive to Hakodate city and as such I decided it was a good, unique and somewhat different place to go for dinner than most other Japanese towns. 
        The chinese-style chicken burger, chips in a mug and unsweetened ice tea were all pretty good and at a great price point (think around 880 yen). 
        What I did find weird was this free plastic wallet I was given when leaving the branch. 
        A member of staff literally chased me out the door to deliver this gift to me - it wasn't on my table and they didn't do table service, so I guess they're given on your way out? 
        Perhaps it was because I'm white and they thought it was good advertisement (quite ironic I suppose as it's in this article). 
        I appreciate the gift and will keep and protect all my souvenir train tickets inside.

        What a great day. 
        Last minute before getting the ferry to Honshu I picked up a locally grown melon. 
        There's lots of drinks and food stuffs based on this exact breed of melon so I felt obliged to try it. 
        Like all melons it was sweet and juicy, would recommend.

        At the ferry terminal and I have to say Japan makes their transport tickets just that bit more fun than we do. 
        The dolphin emoji at the top and faded print in the back is a great mascot for the ferry company, much prettier than any ticket I've received crossing the channel.
