        Geysers and Mountains

        Welcome back to this quiet corner of the internet. 
        I hope you're well wherever you are reading this from. 
        This post will be about my time in Wyoming, specifically the North Western national parks of Yellowstone and Grand Teton. 
        The following few weeks of travel have been booked and planned back in early spring. 
        This is due to the fact I'm very fortunately joined by my lovely girlfriend who has taken the next few weeks off work to come see me out on the road.

        After spending a few nights in Salt Lake City (mostly spent picking up a car rental, getting a hair cut and collecting my travel companion from the airport) we arrive in the Hideaway Hostel in Idaho. 
        This place was a fantastic find - hostel rates out in the middle of the Idaho countryside and only 20 minutes or so from the West entrance to Yellowstone national park. 
        Our chalet hosted 3 rooms each holding between 3 and 6 people. 
        The kitchen area was stocked with everything we needed (even some free breakfast items!) and the upstairs landing had this great little dining table by large glazed windows. 
        We ate dinner up here every day.

        The next morning we head straight for the park with a plan to do the Fairy Falls trail as early as possible to avoid the heat. 
        A vending machine in West Yellowstone sold rental bear spray at around the half the price of buying a canister outright. 
        Seeing lots of warning signs for animals far bigger than anything native in England we picked up a can.

        Yellowstone, in short, is a collection of natural wonders produced by volcanic activity. 
        In the photo below is the Grand Prismatic Spring. 
        It is fed by a natural spring of sulphur rich water from beneath the surface. !FACT CHECK
        The points coming off the edge of the lake are small streams, running the excess water into the nearby Firestick river !CHECK NAME. 
        The minerals in the water cause the majestic colours in the lake. 
        And yes, that is a geyser going off behind it. 
        At the beginning of our walk we saw a sign for this viewpoint and took the detour to see it from above.

        The shade from the woodland around the trail was very much appreciated.

        And we've made it! 
        This is Fairy Falls. 
        It's a fair bit quieter than the rest of the national park as it takes a good hour to walk to. 
        Nonetheless it's definitely worth a visit if you enjoy tall waterfalls. 
        The water free-falls most of the way down producing a satisfying sound and refreshing mist at the base of the falls. 
        We sat and enjoyed this view for a good amount of time before moving on.
