    <h1>
        A peaceful art-filled layover
    </h1>

    <p>
        Flight number one done. I have landed in Keflavik airport in Iceland and it doesn't seem like much has changed since I last visited in 2021. After a quick chat with the service desk on if I can leave the airport (I can) and if it's worth doing so (it isn't) I am now set up on one of the quieter departure wings with a power socket. The wizco charger is working very well and I'm gaining charge on all my devices as I write. A photo of my office away from home is likely to be a common occurrence on this blog. The view, although not natural or breathtaking, is very enjoyable. I have never had enough time in an airport to watch the various plane companies taxi, unload, load and depart their Airbuses before. Watching it all happen out the window in this peaceful wing is quite soothing.

        Icelands international airport is, unsurprisingly, very clean, modern and quiet. For the main airport of a country it is not a big space, but it still features some pretty art and a hanging mosaic for passengers waiting for their flights.

        This piece hangs by (I believe) the entrance for departures. It is called Ikarus (with an accented I which I'm not entirely sure how to type). Apparently it is part of a pair (the other being called Flugbra, "Yearning for flight") but due to that part of the airport being closed off for some sort of refurbishment I only saw this one. Still, it is very beautiful and I'm as impressed with it's intricate design as I was last time I was here.

        This piece is called Silver Sabler and although my Google Search states it was installed in 2017 I don't remember it being there last time. Maybe the refurbishment barriers moved? It is a replica of the original 1999 painting but enlarged and made of ceramic. Being on a corridor with no seating and next to some toilets there aren't many people idly waiting for flights in view of it. I like it, although I do wonder if the character saying "still goes down" is perhaps a bit of a bad omen in an airport.

        It turns out there's actually a lot more art around the airport that I have seen - a glass rainbow arch outside (which you can see in the first photo poking above the plane!) and a fair few sculptures. These are just the ones I spotted. I'm off for an overpriced pizza. Unless I accidentally get on a plane heading east, the next update will be from the supposed land of the free. See you there.
