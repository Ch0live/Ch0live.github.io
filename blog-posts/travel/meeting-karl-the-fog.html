    <h2>
        Meeting Karl the Fog
    </h2>
    <p>
        San Francisco, one of the iconic cities of the USA. 
        We arrived around midday and checked in to an AirBnB in the Sunset District. 
        Although it was a house share booking the owners had converted their basement into an independent flat with bathroom and kitchen. 
        2 bedrooms shared this space and our neighbor for our visit was quite the character. 
        A middle aged man between houses was our neighbor and advised we went to the !FESTIVAL. 
        Not being the types to enjoy that sort of thing we politely declined.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Golden Gate Park
    </h2>
    <p>
        Heading into town we first visited Golden Gate park. 
        These steps lead us to the viewpoint at the top of Strawberry Hill.
    </p>

    <p>
        The visibility, bad at the base of the climb, sadly did not improve. 
        We learnt online that the peninsula San Francisco is built on is prone to low hanging cloud like this. 
        Locals have named it Karl and we discovered during our time here Karl even has an Instagram account. 
        Thanks to him this was our view from the top.

        Heading further into the park we found a Japanese garden. 
        The Japanese Tea Garden (to be specific), set up in 1894 is the oldest Japanese garden in the United States. 
        Originally built as part of a World's Fair, the California Midwinter International Exposition. 
        In contrast to the western design of the city the garden has pagodas and a tea house.

    <p>
        A fun shaped "Taiko Bashi", or drum bridge arches over one of the rivers running through the park. 
        Lots of people were enjoying taking quirky photos of themselves atop the steep steps.
    </p>

        Koi fish could be seen throughout the bodies of water here, close enough to examine their intricate scales.

    <p>
        Here is a photo of the pagoda situated in the center of the park. 
        The paths nearest the structure were closed so this is as close as we could get. 
        Blending in with the well kept green trees and bushes the red and yellow colours looks beautiful, even in this dreary weather.
