    <h1>
        Los Angeles
    </h1>
    <p>
        After hours of driving we finally arrive in Pasadena where we stayed for 5 days. 
        As a cost-effective choice we booked an AirBnB where we stayed in a spare bedroom of someones house. 
        Our host owned a beautiful house a few roads up the hill from the main high street of Pasadena and was very accommodating. 
        Getting to the house late in the evening we went for a short drive into town for some dinner and went quickly to bed.

    <h2>
        A walk by the Hollywood sign
    </h2>
    <p>
        Day 1 was planned around exploring the Hollywood area. 
        We're talking the stereotypical spots of LA, with arguably the most iconic sight of this town, the Hollywood sign. 
        there is a walk between the neighborhoods here which made for a nice way to see the area in view of the sign.
    </p>
    <p>
        This park by the beginning of the walk was full of people taking photos and recording videos, a common sight in this town. 
        I'm in no way saying we didn't also take a few photos, but by no means did we milk this view to the extend some were. 
        I'll never get use to people recording TikTok's...
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/los-angeles/IMG_5071.jpeg" alt="Lake Hollywood Park">
    <p>
        I couldn't help taking a photo of this beautiful car. 
        Reverse image search has revealed this to be a 1973 Cadillac Eldorado convertible, and I am certain that's what it is as my search just found this exact car - it's a <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/en-gb/los-angeles-l179/discover-la-in-a-1973-cadillac-eldorado-convertible-t658954/?visitor-id=WSQ89DO8FI07NNZXVHVAPFNYTDA9UM9Q&locale_autoredirect_optout=true&utm_medium=sharing&utm_campaign=activity_details_desktop">bookable experience on GetYourGuide</a>! 
        Not that I had any idea of this when I was there at the time.
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/los-angeles/IMG_5076.jpeg" alt="1974 Cadillac">
    <p>
        The walk was hot, dry and exactly like it is in the movies. 
        This city has a strong familiarity that I expected but was still a bit baffled by.

        After our short hike we drove up to the Griffith Observatory, a place (like many landmarks in LA) I recognize from playing GTA 5. 
        We weren't able to go inside but the view from the small walkway around the front showed the whole city and ocean in the distance.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Downtown Hollywood
    </h2>
        <p>
        From the viewpoint we drove down to the Hollywood Walk of Fame to see all the famous names written on the floor. 
        I was surprised to find out even fictional characters had been added to the list; hilariously Shrek has his own star in the walk.
        The stars have symbols to denote what category they were awarded the star from. 
        These are Motion picture, Television, Radio, Recording, Live performance and Sports Entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Near the end of the road we peaked in to the Dolby Theatre and read the top movies aired per year. 
        The names are written on tall glass columns that border the main footway in. 
        We also passed the Original Grauman's Chinese Theater just next door where clearly Borderlands 3 was the feature film to see. I've never seen entrance-way decoration for a premier like it!
    </p>

    <p>
        Add more (at least 1 image) of us going in shops here, maybe the Acai bowl place?
    </p>
    <p>
        We grabbed an Acai bowl from nearby and while walking through a nearby market found this cute sweet stand. 
        They really did seem to have every kind of "candy" you can imagine.

    <h2>
        The Bladerunner Building
    </h2>
    <p>
        The night we arrived in LA I was on Atlas Obscura (first mentioned in my <a href="./visiting-the-brew-crew.html">previous Milwaukee post</a>), trying to find interesting things to do in town. 
        This unassuming came up as a top unusual attraction. 
        The outside is unassuming, but the interior may give away the significance of this place...
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/los-angeles/IMG_5238.jpeg" alt="Bradbury Building exterior">
    <p>
        This is the Bradbury building.
        As you can see the interior is certainly unique, being a combination of beautiful glazed stone brick and wraught-iron railings and lifts. 
        Any final guesses...?
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/los-angeles/IMG_5239.jpeg" alt="Bradbury Building interior">
    <p>
        Ok I'll tell you. 
        <b>This is one of the filming locations for the original Bladerunner film</b>! 
        It was in these walls that Harrison Ford fought the replicant in that penultimate scene. 
        Now looking it up it's been featured in many other films as well - a common shoot location, especially among sci-fi pictures.

    <h2>
        The Last Bookshop
    </h2>
    <p>
        Another fun place to visit in Downtown LA is "The Last Bookshop". 
        Across 2 stories is this labyrinth of books and displays.
        Large greek columns in the ground floor area made for a unique and interesting space. 
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/los-angeles/IMG_5260.jpeg" alt="The Last Bookshop ground floor">
    <p>
        Book bundles - a set of mystery books for someone based on a theme. 
        A great idea! 
        No wonder they're almost sold out.

        This is kinda day 1, maybe can split this into 2 posts? A lot to cover otherwise.
        Definitely should cut down on images.
