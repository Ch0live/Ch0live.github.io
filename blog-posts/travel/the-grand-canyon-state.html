    <h1>
        The Grand Canyon State
    </h1>
    <p>
        We arrived back at the car in the early afternoon and got straight on the road. 
        Expecting this drive section to be more than a 6 hour job that needed to be done we had our expectations low for the journey. 
        Our route followed highway 89 from St. George. down through Page and Flagstaff and finishing in Grand Canyon Junction. 
        Believe it or not, we drove <i>around</i> the Grand Canyon. 
        I knew we'd be there after dark, but I didn't predict the beauty we'd see along the way.

        The southern Utah-Arizona drive along highway 89 is stunning. 
        Large expansive areas bounded by red rock cliffs surround the single road that weaves across. 
        As a child of Pixar I can say it is very reminiscent of the first Cars film and Lightnings experience of isolation was felt by the both of us. 
        For every hour of driving we saw only large trucks and a few cars.

        Below is a photo of the sign that once gave information on the view above. 
        Being in such a remote location I am not surprised the entire thing was defaced. 
        I find it fun to read what people write on things like this. 
        An awful lot of it was Trump related which makes sense with the election coming a few months from when this was taken.

        Be warned some comments in the image below are explicit or inaccurate. 
        A good rule for life: never take seriously scrawlings on an old sign.

        Part of the drive went through Navajoland, an Indian reservation of the Navajo people. 
       In 1864 the Navajo (or <i>Din√©</i> in their tongue, meaning '(the) people') were forcibly relocated to an internment camp in an event now known as the Long Walk. 
        At least 200 died walking to Bosque Redondo and 3000 in the camp due to starvation, disease and exhaustion. 
        In 1868 they were permitted return to their traditional boundaries, where the photo below was taken. 
        What the Americans (and in part the British) did to the Native Americans was truly terrible; to try to capture it in a blog article would be impossible. 
        For those interested I would first learn about the Trail of Tears, one of the greatest losses of life from European colonisation of North America.

        By the time we got to Grand Canyon Junction it was completely dark. 
        A thunderstorm had passed over the Grand Canyon which we watched in the distance, but fortunately it did not cross paths with our drive.

        Grand Canyon Junction is a small collection of hotels, restaurants and attractions. 
        It seems to serve exactly what it's name suggests - as a place to rest before heading to the Grand Canyon. 
        Perfect for our needs.
