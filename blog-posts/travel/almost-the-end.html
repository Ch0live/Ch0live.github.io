        Almost the end

        Hello again everyone. 
        It is the 7th of December and for once I'm not writing this post retrospectively. 
        I am actually sat outside at this table writing this article, sipping tea and eating shortbread (thank you Auntie!)
    </p>

    <p>
        In 6 days I'll be returning home to the UK. 
        I have a few more days here in Christchurch staying with family. 
        Along lending me a bunch of camping equipment, they've been very accommodation to my plans (if you are reading this thank you!). 
        Now at the time of writing this...

    <h2>
        I am behind!
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have a planned 34 articles to write of my travels and wish to complete as soon as possible. 
        It's also become quite clear to me how many mistakes I have made in the existing posts so some time to review again my older work would not go amiss. 
        So, here's the plan. 
        <b>The (self imposed) deadline to complete all my traveling related articles is the 2nd of January</b> (or by the end of New Years Day).  
        It was always ambitious thinking I'd write every day on this little MacBook Air while on the road, but I didn't wish to fall this far behind. 
        With a desire to have a complete log of what I did (and hopefully to the interest of anyone else reading this) I'm setting this target and am hopeful I'll meet it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope you are all doing well out there. 
        This Pom's nearly ready to fly home.
