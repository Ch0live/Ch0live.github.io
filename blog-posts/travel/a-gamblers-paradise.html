        <i>28th to 30th July 2024</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        That's right, we made it. 
        A world famous town thanks to it's casino packed strip; 
        In this article I'll fill you in on everything we saw in Las Vegas. 
    </p>
    <h1>
        A Gamblers Paradise
    </h1>
    <p>
        We arrived in afternoon of the 28th, checking into a hotel room in the Sahara Resort. 
        The room was $50 a night and was by far the best value for money room my girlfriend and I had stayed in so far on this trip. 
        Nice comfy bed, big mirror and access to 2 pool areas it was a very glamorous place to stay. 
        And as this is America, plenty of (free!) parking.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sahara Hotel is at the top end of the Las Vegas strip. 
        After settling in to our room eating a bit of food we headed South towards the nightlife of this crazy luminous town.

    <p>
        Luminous it was! 
        No building was spared from being caked in lights, decoration or LED screens. 
        Adverts popped out at you from signs, cars and entire hotel building sides. 
        It's enough to make you forget to look as you cross the road. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Not wanting to stay out too late on our first night we turned around next to the Hilton Hotel, 
        although en route we did decide to explore one casino.

    <h2>
        Quarter Slots and Roller Coasters
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the huge clown sign, tent roof or name wasn't evidence enough for you, I can tell you this casino is circus themed. 
        Big glittery lights line the building entrance where residents get our of their cars for valet service. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The first building you enter into is Slots a Fun - a large floor simply covered in slots. 
        I found the sounds of the casino floor unique here; where other casinos are noisy with people and music Slots a Fun was noisy with the rattling of quarters. 
        Almost all the machines in the immediate area were quarter (25 cent) coin slot machines. 
        Being so cheap I chucked a couple of quarters into one and by pure luck walked about about 75 cent richer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you investigate further into the casino you will eventually walk into the theme park. 
        This was the main reason I wanted to go into Circus Circus (most reviews were fairly negative), people were claiming there was a full theme park inside the casino. 
        Although fairly dated and of course full of kids up past their bedtimes, Adventuredome was in fact that. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Entry was free but every arcade game and ride had a cost per ride. 
        I realised how much I preferred the Thorpe Park model of paying entry and every ride inside is free, although if you just want to see the place this does allow you to do so for nothing. 
        The roller coaster was pretty big and went quite fast but we decided to not ride it; If your in Vegas for one night don't come here it really isn't that spectacular. 
        Nonetheless the kids I assume staying at the hotel seemed to be having a good time.
