        <i>28th to 30th July 2024</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        That's right, we made it. 
        A world famous town thanks to it's casino packed strip; 
        In this article I'll fill you in on everything we saw in Las Vegas. 
    </p>
    <h1>
        A Gamblers Paradise
    </h1>
    <p>
        We arrived in afternoon of the 28th, checking into a hotel room in the Sahara Resort. 
        The room was $50 a night and was by far the best value for money room my girlfriend and I had stayed in so far on this trip. 
        Nice comfy bed, big mirror and access to 2 pool areas it was a very glamorous place to stay. 
        And as this is America, plenty of (free!) parking.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sahara Hotel is at the top end of the Las Vegas strip. 
        After settling in to our room eating a bit of food we headed South towards the nightlife of this crazy luminous town. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Luminous it was! 
        No building was spared from being caked in lights, decoration or LED screens. 
        Adverts popped out at you from signs, cars and entire hotel building sides. 
        It's enough to make you forget to look as you cross the road. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Not wanting to stay out too late on our first night we turned around next to the Hilton Hotel, 
        although en route we did decide to explore one casino.

            Circus Circus

    <h2>
        Quarter Slots and Roller Coasters
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the huge clown sign, tent roof or name wasn't evidence enough for you, I can tell you this casino is circus themed. 
        Big glittery lights line the building entrance where residents get our of their cars for valet service. 
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/a-gamblers-paradise/IMG_3838.heic" alt="Circus Circus entrance">
    <p>
        The first building you enter into is Slots a Fun - a large floor simply covered in slots. 
        I found the sounds of the casino floor unique here; where other casinos are noisy with people and music Slots a Fun was noisy with the rattling of quarters. 
        Almost all the machines in the immediate area were quarter (25 cent) coin slot machines. 
        Being so cheap I chucked a couple of quarters into one and by pure luck walked about about 75 cent richer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you investigate further into the casino you will eventually walk into the theme park. 
        This was the main reason I wanted to go into Circus Circus (most reviews were fairly negative), people were claiming there was a full theme park inside the casino. 
        Although fairly dated and of course full of kids up past their bedtimes, Adventuredome was in fact that. 
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/a-gamblers-paradise/IMG_3845.heic" alt="Adventuredome rollercoaster">
    <p>
        Entry was free but every arcade game and ride had a cost per ride. 
        I realised how much I preferred the Thorpe Park model of paying entry and every ride inside is free, although if you just want to see the place this does allow you to do so for nothing. 
        The roller coaster was pretty big and went quite fast but we decided to not ride it; If your in Vegas for one night don't come here it really isn't that spectacular. 
        Nonetheless the kids there seemed to be having a good time, I assume staying at the resort.

    <h2>
        Replica buildings
    </h2>
    <p>
        The key attraction to this casino is definitely its construction. 
        The facade on its front are reconstructions of the cities major landmarks. 
        The statue of liberty, brooklyn bridge and even a little replica skyline are all featured. 
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/a-gamblers-paradise/IMG_3875.heic" alt="New York New York entrance facade">
    <p>
        Inside is a casino floor, hotel and a lot of shops. 
        I assume the business model is to capitalize off the winners at the casino. 
        Based on the surprisingly high number of families that were there I think appealing to children would've been more profitable. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Walkways between the casinos as photographed below take people up and down the strip, with lots of opportunity to see all the architectural oddities in Vegas. 
        Below is a photo of the Excalibur casino which has a fantasy castle theme. 
        Due to the long entrance flat escalators transport you under the castle towers and into the casino itself. 
        At this point I began to realise how similar all the casinos looked on the actual casino floor. 
        Due to new digital gambling machines they really didn't feel that different once you were among the actual machines.

        Another iconic building on the strip, the Luxor casino follows an Egyptian theme. 
        It's sphinx entrance and pyramid hotel structure is really impressive. 
        The sides of the pyramid must be an advertisers dream being huge, flat and completely unmissable. 
        I am glad while I visited it was clean of anything, it's massive scale is very unclear in the image above. 
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/a-gamblers-paradise/IMG_3924.heic" alt="Luxor interior">
    <p>
        Inside the building the typical design of a basement casino and everything else on top is present. 
        While we visited a Titanic exhibit was on which featured lots of artifacts from the sunken ship. 
        I took the image above to show the vast space inside the building. 
        I kind of wished I stayed here; it would have been cool to look out from your hotel floor over the whole area.
