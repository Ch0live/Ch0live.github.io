        Ok, I need more time
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hello again. 
        It's winter time here in the UK and I'm splitting a pile of old wooden floor tiles into kindling. 
        When the tiles have no knots in them the pieces split very easily; it's a very satisfying job.

        For those who read 
        <a href="/blog-posts/travel/coffee-art-and-old-clocks.html">
            my ambitious post during my last few days in New Zealand
        </a> will know I planned to finish all my travel blog posts by the end of the Christmas break. 
        At this point it is clear - it's not going to be done in time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy setting these targets for myself to keep me motivated to finish projects. 
        However the idea of pulling some late nights to just barely cover what I did even in a paragraph per location is just completely infeasible. 
        As always with plans, life got in the way. 
        Not in a bad way, I've been having a blast catching up with old friends and spending time with family. 
        But I have not estimated quite how much work completing my travel blog would be. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on a few posts I've written in the past few days I think a healthy amount of time to complete one of the posts is 2 and 1/2 hours. 
        I have the following locations I'd like to write about left to do: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 in America</li>
        <li>11 in Japan</li>
        <li>1 in Indonesia</li>
        <li>about 5 in Australia</li>
        <li>about 7 in New Zealand</li>
        <li>a couple in Singapore</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This equates to about 85 hours of work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing this blog is not my only hobby and even if it was, I return to work in the new year. 
        It's just going to take a little bit of time. 
        If I can dedicated 5 hours a week (which I think is a reasonable and sustainable amount) I should have everything written up by the end of April. 
        I could be done in half or even a quarter of that time, but I want to make sure I capture as much as I can remember about this trip; 
        regardless of who reads this it is primarily for myself to look back on where I went and what I did. 
        Sorry to my aunt who has been emailing me asking about when I'll "get around to the rest of this blog". 
        I'll get around to it all soon!
    </p>
