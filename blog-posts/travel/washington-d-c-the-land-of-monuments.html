        Hello readers. I write to you from a cosy corner in my hostel/hotel style accommodation. They seem to do both kinds 
        of rooms here, which I guess explains why the lobby is so nice. First major city of the trip. Here's what I've been up to.
    </p>

        The drive down to Washington D.C took about 5 1/2 hours, but I arrived in 
        the evening with enough time to walk down to the capitol mall before it got dark. With the car parked in 
        the garage beneath the hotel and my valuables stowed away in my shared room locker I walked to the Abraham 
        Lincoln memorial, fortunately only around 30 minutes from my bed for the next few days.

        Being about 6pm on a 
        Saturday it was heaving with tourist. In 2024 it seems most people spend more time trying to get a good photo of 
        themselves next to the landmark to share with others than actually looking at it. After traveling all this way, 
        I do have to wonder why some people pay so much to then spend half the time looking at Abraham through 
        their phone screen. I'm now resolved to only spend a moment taking photos of where I am, and will try to follow 
        it up with 5 more of just looking and enjoying. Opposite the memorial is the reflection pool (which I have to admit 
        I recognise first from Forrest Gump when he reunites with Jenny after his service) and behind it the rest of the 
        "Capitol Mall".

        I continued to stroll around until it was dark, including a soaking of my feet in the WW2 memorial. I encourage 
        everyone to learn about the wars, but in particular the 2nd World War, with by far the most bloodshed of any conflict 
        in human history. The memorial commemorates not just a battalion, or an army, but a whole generation that was caught up 
        by pure chance in a very dark time. It could have been anyone. Lest we forget.

        The next day was a 30,000 step day, visiting 4 different museums and viewing the various other monuments on the Mall. 
        I got this cool shot of the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue. Looks like a lot of roads lead out from the 
        Capitol building, like spokes on a wheel. As a result driving or walking around the city you end up spotting it 
        unusually often. The same is sort of true for the White House, but as it's obscured by foliage from behind it's not so 
        eye-catching.

        Now of course, I had to go to the Air & Space museum. I knew there would be lots on about the moon landings and other 
        aviation history. Although I somehow forgot that this museum displays the original Wright brothers plane, a really quite 
        impressive piece when you think about it. The only part that has been replaced is the fabric on the wings - the wooden 
        parts are original!

        I got this photo of a new exhibit being built for later this year supposedly, any thoughts on what it's about? The gold 
        foil object suggests is a space related room, but then there's a propeller powered plane as well. Maybe the theme is plastic 
        wrapped objects. If so I'd say they're almost finished.

        More space stuff. They had replicas of all the lunar (lunar? I think it's lunar) rovers used on the missions to Mars or the Moon.

        And even the command module from Apollo 11 named "Columbia" (the one where Neil Armstrong walked on the monn). It's the only part 
        of the rocket that returned to Earth.

        Next I went to the National Indian American museum. The exhibit was very well done, featuring information on how America became 
        populated with Europeans, ways the Native Americans were relocated (for those interested search "the trail of tears", a very sad 
        story) as well as information on how they lived and the number of tribes. One piece was an art installation of the American flag 
        with each star being represented as the 2 digit code for the states established by the USA and in every stripe the name of the 450 
        or so tribes that originally lives in North America.

        Below is a signpost from the Standing Rock protests. In 2016 the US planned to add a pipeline through the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's 
        lands and over concerns about water contamination the tribe protested against it's construction. Supporters of the tribe came from far 
        and wide, adding to this sign where they had come from and how far they had traveled to protest in what is now North Dakota. The 
        demonstration gained a lot of attention due to the sheer amount of support from afar, encapsulated in this sign. However in the end the 
        Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) was ultimately completed in June 2017.

        Afterwards I went to the National Postal Museum, a recommendation from a podcast I listened to when walking around on my first day. 
        I found this one of the most enjoyable museums, fellow logistical nerds out there check this one out if you're ever in town. Below is 
        the first stamp ever printed - the Penny Black - first issued in the United Kingdom on 1 May 1840, showing Queen Victoria.

    <p>
        Before visiting this museum I had no idea just how many different series of stamp designs have been commissioned. The museum has a huge 
        vault of stamps from decades of US postal history. I've listed photos of a few of the designs I liked the best.

        Yep. Even one for when they threw our precious tea into the Boston Harbour.
