    <h1>
        Java to Javascript; A Workflow Analysis
    </h1>
    <p>
        In my first 6 months of training as a developer I learnt how to create Java back-end applications. However
        recently I have begun working on front end projects, requiring a whole new set of skills. Writing Javascript is
        something I'm upskilling in and while I'm able to create webpages and unit test simple code using Jest I am less
        aware of all the other available tooling within a front end ecosystem. So what tools are there around Javascript
        that I may have seen Java equivalent versions of before?
    </p>
    <h2>
        Writing code the TDD way
    </h2>
    <p>
        With Java, adding to a code base is a case of adding or expanding functions and classes to implement new
        functionality.
        Lots of aspects of Java (such as interfaces and Java's type safety) remove the need for testing, but to
        guarantee a codebase's health JUnit and Mockito have been my tools of choice for adding unit tests.
        Using Spring MockMVC I've been able to mock endpoint request calls and responses for integration testing of
        these MVC Spring Applications also.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Javascript, unit testing is most commonly done through Jest.
        It's declarative structure is a little confusing at first sight (`describe` then `it`?), but the concepts are
        the same.
        Instead of calling declared functions more often I find myself rendering React components and asserting on what
        they return.
        Cypress, a full fledged front end testing framework <!-- <check this>  --> is something that may tailor front
        end visual testing better.
        I'll add this to my "To learns".
    </p>

    <h2>
        Assuring code formatting and order
    </h2>

    <p>
        For styling code, the first tool I learnt to use was Checkstyle.
        This utility will flag styling inconsistencies within your code according to a set of rules.
        Most often pre defined rule sets are used, but rules can be added, reworded or removed entirely if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
        The front end equivalent I have found (and seems to be standard everywhere for JS and TS) is Prettier. Prettier
        works almost identically to Checkstyle - checking for formatting issues. VSCode includes a widely downloaded
        extension to enforce Prettier rules on save, a very helpful utility for applying this tool. I imagine checkstyle
        has the same sort of extension for IntelliJ, something I should look into.
    </p>


    <h2>Automated code assessment</h2>

    <p>
        My first encounter with a linter was PMD. It scans all changes like Checkstyle but checks for more nuanced
        issues
        within the logic of the code; more specifically areas of improvement. One time use declared variables or types
        that
        can be more specifically defined are flagged to the user. Spotting minor mistakes a human can make with machine
        consistency can be (and is) quite useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a front end linter I have learnt to use ESLint. A tool I had the luck of setting up myself for a client
        project,
        It flags code logic issues just like PMD does. It's `.eslintrc` file contains ruleset configuration and files to
        ignore can be included in an `.eslintignore`. VSCode also supports some fantastic ESLint extensions that will
        check
        your code as you write (no need to run any commands at all!)
    </p>


    <h2>
        Finding bugs
    </h2>

    <p>
        Like the Mark II machine that
        <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/september/9/">required a moth removed</a> , I
        too
        need to be able to debug my work. IntelliJ includes a "debug" mode that, once understood well,
        is revolutionary to understanding issues in code. I'd compare fixing Java code problems before I used this debug
        tool to
        solving a crime with no evidence. Adjusting code blindly, perhaps throwing a `console.log` here and there,
        hoping
        one of the attempts will unearth the issue. Seeing all your variables state at any given time, being able to
        step
        over & through line by line allows a developer to find the exact point everything goes awry and it's brilliantly
        useful.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've learnt a lot about Google Chrome's devtools for fixing CSS issues, but not so much for the Javascript logic
        in my front-end work. And as much as I rave about the usefulness of a debugger in Java, I am still yet to use
        one in
        Javascript. I've definitely felt the need for one many times, but I'm yet to have the opportunity, remote
        desktop
        permission, time, energy (or whatever excuse I feel like using at time time) to explore how to use one. This
        will
        definitely be at the top of my list of things to explore in the near future, my writing of this paragraph is
        making
        that very clear!
    </p>

    <h2>Dependency management</h2>

    <p>
        I have experienced the benefits and difficulties of using Maven and Gradle. Although I must state I have never
        set
        any of these build-automation tools up, I do feel they simplify the area I've worked the most with - package
        management. Adding Checkstyle and PMD (something a team member did on a recent project) also seems very
        painless.
    </p>

    <p>
        For front end package management I've used Node, more specificaly it's package manager npm. Creating config
        through
        terminal import commands makes quickly setting up projects easy, plus it seems almost every sort of dependency
        you
        could want is posted to nodes package registry. I have no desire to look for an alternative tool, this one seems
        perfect.
    </p>

    <h2>
        So... What's missing?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Exploring the equivalent front and back end tooling has highlighted some things I should look into learning
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>A front end debugger.</b>
            I definitely clarified in my head the benefit of a debugger in this article.
            Now realising I'm yet to learn how to debug Javascript has
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>More extensive testing tooling.</b>
            With only expeience in Jest I should check out what else I can use to test my code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Checkstyle & PMD Extensions.</b>
            Perhaps all my envy for the convenience of the Prettier and ESLint extensions can be resolved?
        </li>
    </ol>
