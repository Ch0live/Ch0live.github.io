        What is Postcrossing?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Great question! 
        I've never mentioned on my blog anywhere the term and until I went looking into the surrounding hobby of Philately I'd never heard it either. 
        However I have now been using it for !TIMELENGTH and am keen to write up a little piece on what it is, how it works and why I love participating.
