    <h1>
        Stick-to-itiveness
    </h1>
    <p>
        Although this line is a joke from an episode of the Simpsons' golden era, it is a fun phrase that embodies a quality I praise highly yet often fall short of. 
        For those who haven't seen the episode, Skinner tries to ask an intelligent question to Mr Burns about which quality is more important - "hard work or stick-to-itiveness".

        I think we can all agree stick-to-itiveness is not a word, and Mr Burns quite rightly ignores him asking "are any <i>real</i> questions?". But it is a phrase that embodies a quality that is important in achievement.

        I find it easy thinking up ideas of things to do in my free time. Finding desire to do certain projects or hobbies is something I've always found easy. In childhood I would pick up a new skill or hobby such as modelling, a sport or even niche skills such as dice stacking. That last one drove my siblings crazy with the noise I'd make dropping and scattering red casino dice across my room. But even now as an adult I still have this short term burst of interest in things that are quickly abandoned and replaced with the next thing.

    <p>
        Here's a list of things that I've been obsessed with at some point in my adult life
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guitar</li>
        <li>Running</li>
        <li>Blogging</li>
        <li>Video editing</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>All kinds of collecting</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        and although this is a wide spread of hobbies or skills I have tried, it brings about the issue a jack-of-all-traits approach has - I'm not great at any of them. Maybe good, mostly ok, but never great.

        My interest in these different activities is constantly changing. Some I pick up once, obsess over for a few months and then never return to. Others I've picked up with big ambitions of pursuing for a long time, making plans on what I can do with it, but every time I've given up on completing those plans. Writing my own app, creating an EP or running the big 6 marathons are all things I'd <i>like</i> to achieve, and I'll happily plan out how I will get there for each one, yet my ability to stick to any of the plans I write seems to fail every time.

        I'm sure a lot of people don't feel like this. They may have an interest that holds their attention for a long time and they become very experienced and able in that area or activity. Or perhaps they don't have any specific interest and generally just enjoy their free time doing a variety of things. But a few readers I'm sure have the same feeling of getting distracted from something they want to focus on.
