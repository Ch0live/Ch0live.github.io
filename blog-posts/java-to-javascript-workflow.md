# Java to Javascript Workflow

General idea

During my developer training and first project I learnt how to develop Java applications. Could it be interesting to compare all the processes, tooling, workflow, etc. from my Java work to a front end equivalent language such as Javascript? Something I have just recently started but am far less proficient in

Topics I can discuss my Java workflow

How I wrote new code test driven development with JUnit unit testing (where possible), use Checkstyle and PMD to ensure code quality, code run within a terminal and results seen either in terminal output or a database change
How I solved problems IntelliJ debugger, step through code 1 line at a time (very helpful!), Git commit history
How I managed the project/tooling Maven for plugins & dependency, IntelliJ for all sorts of checks
