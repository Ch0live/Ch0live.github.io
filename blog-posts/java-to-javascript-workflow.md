# Java to Javascript; A Workflow Analysis

During my developer training and first project I learnt how to develop Java applications. However recently I have begun working on some front end projects, requiring a whole new set of skills. Writing Javascript is something I am currently upskilling in and while I'm able to create webpages and unit test simple code using Jest I am less aware of all the other available tooling within a front end ecosystem. So what tools are there around Javascript that I may have seen Java equivalent versions of before?

## How to write code the TDD way

With Java, adding to a code base is a case of expanding or adding functions or classes to implement new functionality. Lots of aspects (interface object security, type safety, etc.) of Java don't need testing, but to guarantee a codebase's health JUnit and Mockito have been my tools of choice for adding unit tests.


## Assuring code formatting and order

<!-- use PMD to ensure code quality, code run within a terminal and results seen either in terminal output or a database change -->

## Automated code assessment

<!-- use PMD to ensure code quality, code run within a terminal and results seen either in terminal output or a database change -->


## How to remove stuck bugs

Like the Mark II machine that [required a moth removed](https://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/september/9/), I too need to be able to debug my work.

<!-- IntelliJ debugger, step through code 1 line at a time (very helpful!), Git commit history -->

## How to manage packages and dependencies

<!-- the project/tooling Maven for plugins & dependency, IntelliJ for all sorts of checks -->
