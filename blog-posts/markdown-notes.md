# The strengths of Markdown (title WIP)
Markdown is a brilliant tool for quickly writing up universally accessible documents.
Created by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004, it stands as one of the most popular and widely used markup languages
([site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language))
 around.
 Quick and simple formatting that can be read plainly makes it a great tool for many applications.
 Personally, I believe it's greatest strength to most people is through using it as a note-taking tool.

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

A Markdown file can be both a quick to do list, written and looked at exclusively in it's raw form.
But it can also be a well organized and formatted ideas space.

## Core Tools in the base Markdown Language
Markdown comes with a myriad of syntax rules for organizing
By far the three most common tools you will use when writing in Markdown are lists, links and headings.
Adding these three components to your document is fast, easy and very legible.
Typically when I write meeting notes, quick checklists or timeboxed research these 3 tools are all I use.
And being able to simply copy and paste the text to another space (a key strength of all markup languages) removes any formatting issues experienced with more sophisticated text editors.

## Markdown flavours
As more people began to use Markdown for more bespoke documents, the demand for specific features in the language grew. Enter Markdown flavours - a range of extensions on the language increasing it's capabilities and utility.

- easy example is GitHub's flavour, which supports programming language selection


## What else can it do?
- Compile to HTML (show the presentation in HTML on personal page) (try and create JavaScript interpreter with [commonmark.js](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js))
- Markdown presentations (maybe finish the talk with this as it would be a good way to view the content)
- Used for GitHub READMEs with lots of extendable tools
- Make print-ready documents like documents in Word or Publisher
- Showdownjs: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown

## So who writes in Markdown?
It's very likely you discovered Markdown first through GitHub.
README files are famously written in Markdown, using the GitHub flavour.
GitHub also uses Markdown for GitHub account bio pages
[source](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
and GitHub pages use Jekyll, a software designed to turn Markdown files into simple static HTML websites
[source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

## The good
- Used by lots of people, learn once used everywhere
- Readable when raw (unlike HTML)
- Platform independent
- As someone who had to write technical reports in uni in LaTeX, it's much nicer. Much more predictable behaviour, simpler syntax, more widely used

## The bad
- Unstandardised in it's creation
  - community attempts to standardise [Like CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

## Other notes
- The presentation could have gifs of each tool used in Atom with the rendered Markdown on the RHS
