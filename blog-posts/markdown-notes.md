# Markdown presentation/blogpost notes

## History and reasoning
- a "*lightweight markup language*"
- Created by John Gruber and  Aaron Schwartz in 2004

## Core Markdown tools you can use
- Lists, Links and Headings
I use it for quick meeting notes, daily checklists, timeboxed research tasks thanks to these quick tools
- Tables

## Markdown flavours
- Extensions on the Markdown syntax
- easy example is GitHub's flavour, which supports programming language selection

## What else can it do?
- Compile to HTML (show the presentation in HTML on personal page) (try and create JavaScript interpreter with [commonmark.js](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js))
- Markdown presentations (maybe finish the talk with this as it would be a good way to view the content)
- Used for GitHub READMEs with lots of extendable tools
- Make print-ready documents like documents in Word or Publisher

## The good
- Used by lots of people, learn once used everywhere
- Readable when raw (unlike HTML)
- Platform independent
- As someone who had to write technical reports in uni in LaTeX, it's much nicer. Much more predictable behaviour, simpler syntax, more widely used

## The bad
- Unstandardised in it's creation
  - community attempts to standardise [Like CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

## Other notes
- The presentation could have gifs of each tool used in Atom with the rendered Markdown on the RHS
