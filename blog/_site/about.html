<p>This is my new space on the internet for blogging and other content I create</p>

<p>Ideally I’d like to add a Markdown interpreter like Jekyll to this part of my personal site, where I can simply dump .md files and have fully formatted posts.
However, I also want to build this system from the ground up to understand exactly how it works, taking shortcuts with a pre-built GitHub pages site is too easy and I’ll lose learning and customization opportunity.</p>

<p>For now this space will remain rather blank as I work on this site.
I hope to add more content here in the future.</p>
