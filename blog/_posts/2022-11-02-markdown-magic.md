# The strengths of Markdown (title WIP)
Markdown is a brilliant tool for quickly writing up universally accessible documents.
Created by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004, it stands as one of the most popular and widely used markup languages
([site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language))
 around.
 Quick and simple formatting that can be read plainly makes it a great tool for many applications.
 Personally, I believe it's greatest strength to most people is through using it as a note-taking tool.

> "*A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions*"

A Markdown file can be both a quick to do list, written and looked at exclusively in it's raw form.
But it can also be a well organized and formatted ideas space.

## Core Tools in the base Markdown Language
Markdown comes with a myriad of syntax rules for organizing
By far the three most common tools you will use when writing in Markdown are lists, links and headings.
Adding these three components to your document is fast, easy and very legible.
Typically when I write meeting notes, quick checklists or timeboxed research these 3 tools are all I use.
And being able to simply copy and paste the text to another space (a key strength of all markup languages) removes any formatting issues experienced with more sophisticated text editors.

## Markdown flavours

// add something about `CommonMark`

As more people began to use Markdown for more bespoke documents, the demand for specific features in the language grew. Enter Markdown flavours - a range of extensions on the language increasing it's capabilities and utility. The most common example developers encounter these days is [the GitHub Markdown flavour](https://github.github.com/gfm/), a superset of the widely used [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/). This flavour adds syntax highlighting for a range of programming languages within the Markdown code blocks by simply adding the language to the start of the block

```
```language
\```
```

Other additional tools include [checklist items](https://github.github.com/gfm/#task-list-items-extension-) and text strikethrough. The GitHub flavour interpreter is able to successfully compile these features to HTML.

## So people can expand on Gruber's Markdown syntax, what else can it do?
Markdown was designed to be compiled to HTML as it's primary function. This makes it great for static websites such as blogs and documentation. Markdown can also be used to create presentations using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp). Additional rules are included to dictate the structure and look of the presentation

All GitHub repositories include a Markdown `README.md`. These Markdown files support additional community-made widgets for information like page traffic and package versioning. A good example of one of these tools is the ---
- Are they called [GitHub badges?](https://github.com/puf17640/git-badges#readme)

- Compile to HTML (show the presentation in HTML on personal page) (try and create JavaScript interpreter with [commonmark.js](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js))
- Make print-ready documents like documents in Word or Publisher
- Showdownjs: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown

## So who writes in Markdown?
It's very likely you discovered Markdown first through GitHub.
README files are famously written in Markdown, using the GitHub flavour.
GitHub also uses Markdown for GitHub account bio pages
[source](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
and GitHub pages use Jekyll, a software designed to turn Markdown files into simple static HTML websites
[source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

## The good
- Used by lots of people, learn once used everywhere
- Readable when raw (unlike HTML)
- Platform independent
- As someone who had to write technical reports in uni in LaTeX, it's much nicer. Much more predictable behaviour, simpler syntax, more widely used

## The bad
- Unstandardised in it's creation
  - community attempts to standardise [Like CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

## Other notes
- The presentation could have gifs of each tool used in Atom with the rendered Markdown on the RHS
- Should do an external question submission page, show at beginning of the talk and when revealing the presentation was itself a Markdown file, switch to it and answer questions (a bit more subtle than messages in the teams chat)
